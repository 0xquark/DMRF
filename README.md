# DMRF
END SEM PROJECT FOR FINDING ROUTE BETWEEN GIVEN STATIONS

# BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT PROJECT :
- DMRF is a program developed in c++ in which a user enters the starting station and end station.
- The program shows
- the shortest route between the two stations,
- Average fare,
- Average time,
- No of stations
- The program uses various concepts of OOPS Programming with an interactive GUI in C++ . The program is made by applying the concepts of arrays , control statements and structures in C++.

# ABSTRACT:
The Delhi Metro is a mass rapid transit system serving Delhi and its satellite cities. It is by far the largest and busiest metro rail system in India. The network consists of 11 colour coded lines serving 255 stations in Delhi with a total length of 348 kilometres. Since it is widely spread, a person constantly needs to change metro lines to reach the destination station. Our project helps a person find the route required to reach the destination.
DMRF is a program developed in c++ that helps a person to find a route to the destination entered. It also finds the total fare, average time and number of stations in the journey. It uses concepts of OOPs, STL, and Data File Handling for its implementation.
